This program is designed to solve any valid variation of the 15 puzzle game
It should work on any linux system that has gcc installed (possibly other compilers as well I haven't checked)
The program can also be run using multiple threads if OpenMP is installed on your system.
I saw about a 20% decrease in runtime (Intel Core i3 4 cores) when run on multiple threads, except for boards that are solved very quickly on one thread there was not much improvement.


COMPILING
  Single Thread
gcc -std=c99 functions15.c main15.c
  Multi-threaded
gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp functions15.c main15.c

RUNNING
It takes as input the 15 possible board values (1-15) and 0 represents the empty space
Example
./a.out 1 5 2 11 4 8 12 0 7 9 3 14 6 10 13 15


For right now this program simply solves a given puzzle, or lets you know if the given board configuration is invalid. It uses the A* heuristic approach for solving the board, a simple linear hashing mechanism for storing the boards. In addition each board is packed into a struct consisting of just 3 integers to minimize memory usage.

MORE TO COME
I have code which generates the move list taken to solve the board and a gui written in Python using gtk so the game can actually be played. Once I clean up the code some I will make it available.
